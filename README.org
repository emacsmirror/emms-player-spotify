* What is it.
This is an implementation of ~emms-player-spotify~ which works as a companion for the desktop app.
It supports =spotify:<type>:<id>= links, e.g. =spotify:track:2BzJno6LURg7HgfokcN9nc= or =spotify:artist:3SYkxKBdwKFCTxWDh9l5f9=.

Features:
- synchronised player state between emms and spotify
  - manual seeking in spotify is recognized by emms
  - play/pause in the app toggles ~emms-player-spotify~ state
- muting ads
- ~emms-player-spotify-following~ minor mode to keep history of played tracks in a dynamic playlist
- integrated with emms modeline module
